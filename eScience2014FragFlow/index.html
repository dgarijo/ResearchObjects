Scientific workflows provide the means to define, execute and reproduce computational experiments. However, reusing existing workflows still poses challenges for workflow designers. Workflows are often too large and too specific to reuse in their entirety, so reuse is more likely to happen for fragments of workflows. These fragments may be identified manually by users as sub-workflows, or detected automatically. In this paper we present the FragFlow approach, which detects workflow fragments automatically by analyzing existing workflow corpora with graph mining algorithms. FragFlow detects the most common workflow fragments, links them to the original workflows and visualizes them. We evaluate our approach by comparing FragFlow results against user-defined sub-workflows
from three different corpora of the LONI Pipeline system. Based on this evaluation, we discuss how automated workflow fragment detection could facilitate workflow reuse.</p>

<p>
The FragFlow approach follows several steps, detailed in the following Figure:
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="images/fragflow workflow.png" alt="FragFlow workflow"></img>
</div>
<p>
First, a data preparation step is necessary to filter and format the workflow corpus. Then a graph mining algorithm is applied (depending on the choice of the user), and the results filtered. Finally the results are visualized, statistics are calculated, and the fragments are linked to the workflows of the corpus where fragments appear.
</p>

<p>
We tested our approach on three different workflow corpora created with the <a href="http://pipeline.loni.usc.edu/">LONI Pipeline workflow system</a>. We obtained two corpora from two different users, containing all the workflows created by them or in collaboration with other people. A third corpus contains the runs of 62 unique users submitted to the LONI Pipeline servers during January 2014.

<ol>
<li><a property="ore:aggregates" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1603171" typeOf="ro:Resource wfdesc:Input">User Corpus 1 (WC1)</a>:
A set of 790 workflows (475 workflows after applying our
filtering) designed mostly by a single user. Some of the
workflows are product of collaborations with other users,
which produced different versions of workflows originally
produced by this user. The domain of the workflows is in
general medical imaging (brain image understanding, 3D skull
imaging, genetic modeling of the face, etc.), and some are still
used by the LONI Pipeline community. Other workflows were
designed for a specific purpose and are not reused anymore.</li>
<li><a property="ore:aggregates" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1603170" typeOf="ro:Resource wfdesc:Input">User Corpus 2 (WC2)</a>
A set of 113 well-documented workflows (96 after
filtering) created and validated by one user, sometimes in
collaboration with others. Most of the workflows have been
made public for others to reuse6, and range from neuroimaging
to genomics. Some of the workflows were developed as early
as 2007, and many of them are being used in different
institutions.</li>
<li><a property="ore:aggregates" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1603174" typeOf="ro:Resource wfdesc:Input">Multi-user Corpus 3 (WC3)</a>
A set of 5859 workflows (357 after filtering), submitted to
LONI pipeline for execution by 62 different users over the
time lapse of a month (Jan 2014). The number of filtered
workflows descends drastically from the input corpus as many
of the executions are on the same workflow or are one
component workflows designed for testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>
After being processed and filtered, these are the input files generated for the SUBDUE and Gspan algorithms:
