      <h3>Research Object List</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://w3id.org/ro">Research Object (RO)</a> is an aggregation of resources that bundles together the contents of an investigation or work. In the context of a publication, Research Objects support what is being described in the paper, describing tools, datasets, queries and executions used for achieving the final results.</p>

From the beginning of 2013 I have starting doing some Research Objects of my recent (or ongoing) research. All ROs are annotated in RDF-a with content negotiation in turtle, rdf and json-ld. You can find them listed below: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is a test to see whether <a href="Drugome_Bundle_page-PLOS/index.html">this RO</a> can be seen through this page</li>
		<li>Another test: <a href="MiningAbstractionsInScientificWfs/index.html">this RO</a></li>
		<li>Mining Abstractions in Scientific Workflows: The Research Object of my PhD thesis.</li>
		<li>Towards Workflow Ecosystems Through Standard Representations:Research Object containing all the evaluation queries made to test the interoperability of WEST, the workflow ecosystem presented at WORKS14. </li>
	</ol>
