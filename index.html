      <h3>Research Object List</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://w3id.org/ro">Research Object (RO)</a> is an aggregation of resources that bundles together the contents of an investigation or work. In the context of a publication, Research Objects support what is being described in the paper, describing tools, datasets, queries and executions used for achieving the final results.</p>

From the beginning of 2013 I have starting creating some Research Objects of my recent (or ongoing) research. All ROs are annotated in RDF-a with content negotiation in turtle, rdf and json-ld. You can find them on Github (<a href="https://github.com/dgarijo/ResearchObjects">https://github.com/dgarijo/ResearchObjects</a>) and listed below: </p>
