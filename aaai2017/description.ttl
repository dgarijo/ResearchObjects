    dc:abstract "The automation of important aspects of scientific data analysis would significantly accelerate the pace of science and innovation. Although important aspects of data analysis can be automated, the hypothesize-test-evaluate discovery cycle is largely carried out by hand by researchers.  This introduces a significant human bottleneck, which is inefficient and can lead to erroneous and incomplete explorations. We introduce a novel approach to automate the hypothesize-test-evaluate discovery cycle with an intelligent system that a scientist can task to test hypotheses of interest in a data repository. Our approach captures three types of data analytics knowledge: 1) common data analytic methods represented as semantic workflows; 2) meta-analysis methods that aggregate those results, represented as meta-workflows; and 3) data analysis strategies that specify for a type of hypothesis what data and methods to use, represented as lines of inquiry.  Given a hypothesis specified by a scientist, appropriate lines of inquiry are triggered, which lead to retrieving relevant datasets, running relevant workflows on that data, and finally running meta-workflows on workflow results.  The scientist is then presented with a level of confidence on the initial hypothesis (or a revised hypothesis) based on the data and methods applied. We have implemented this approach in the DISK system, and applied it to multi-omics data analysis.";
