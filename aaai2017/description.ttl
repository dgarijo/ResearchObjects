    dc:abstract "Scientific data is continuously generated throughout the world. However, analyses of these data are typically performed exactly once and on a small fragment of re-cently generated data. Ideally, data analysis would be a continuous process that uses all the data available at the time, and would be automatically re-run and updated when new data appears. We present a framework for au-tomated discovery from data repositories that tests user-provided hypotheses using expert-grade workflows, and reassesses hypotheses when more data becomes available. Novel contributions of this approach include a framework to trigger new analyses appropriate for the available data through lines of inquiry that support progressive hypothe-sis evolution, and a representation of hypothesis revisions with provenance records that can be used to inspect the results. We implemented our approach in the DISK framework, and evaluated it using two scenarios from cancer multi-omics: 1) data for new patients becomes available over time, 2) new types of data for the same pa-tients are released. We show that in all scenarios the con-fidence on the original hypotheses evolves.";
