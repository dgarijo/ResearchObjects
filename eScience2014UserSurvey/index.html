<p property="dc:abstract">
Workflow reuse is a major benefit of workflow systems and shared workflow repositories, but there are barely any studies that quantify the degree of reuse of workflows or the practical barriers that may stand in the way of successful reuse. In our own work, we hypothesize that defining workflow fragments improves reuse, since end-to-end workflows may be very specific and only partially reusable by others. This paper reports on a study of the current use of workflows and workflow fragments in labs that use the LONI Pipeline, a popular workflow system used mainly for neuroimaging research that enables users to define and reuse workflow fragments. We present an overview of the benefits of workflows and workflow fragments reported by users in informal discussions. We also
report on a survey of researchers in a lab that has the LONI Pipeline installed, asking them about their experiences with reuse of workflow fragments and the actual benefits they perceive. This leads to quantifiable indicators of the reuse of workflows and workflow fragments in practice. </p>

<h4  class="blue"> User survey report</h4>
<p>
To check whether other users would agree or disagree with the benefits one can find in workflows (sharing, time savings, visualization, teaching, standarizaion of the protocols within a lab, being able to reuse methods exposed by other, etc), we created a survey and sent it to the mailing list of users of <a href="http://pipeline.loni.usc.edu/">the LONI Pipeline</a>. We included users who use the LONI Pipeline system installed at USC, but did not include many other users that have downloaded the system and run it themselves in their own servers. The survey was conducted on-line, and the responses were anonymous.
</p>
<p>
A total of 25 scientists have answered the survey. The results are available <a href="25 responses Full Text.xls" property="ore:aggreagates" typeOf="ro:Resource">here</a> (full text responses) and <a href="25 Responses numeric values.xls" property="ore:aggreagates" typeOf="ro:Resource">here</a>(numeric values).

<p>
The complete report with our conclusions can be seen in the <a href="paper.pdf">paper</a>.
