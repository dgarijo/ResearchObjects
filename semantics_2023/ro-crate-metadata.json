The source data is generated with the SOftware Metadata Extraction Framework (SOMEF), which extracts the relevant information of a repository from README files and saves it as JSON files. Then, a knowledge graph that relies on the Software Description Ontology (SDO) is created using RML-star mappings. The resulting knowledge graph is then queried to assess the adoption of a set of representative best practices for research software publishing.",
